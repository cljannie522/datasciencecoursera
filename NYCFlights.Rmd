## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(statsr)
```

```{r sfo-flights}
data(nycflights)
assfo_fed_flights <- nycflights %>% filter(dest=="SFO",month == 2)
nrow(assfo_fed_flights)

# arrival delay in SFO
ggplot(data=assfo_fed_flights,aes(x=arr_delay))+geom_histogram()

# group by carriers and n()reports sample size
assfo_fed_flights %>% group_by(carrier) %>% summarise(median_dd=median(arr_delay),iqr_dd=IQR(arr_delay),n=n())

```

## statistics for all flights
```{r dep_delay}
# default count
ggplot(data=nycflights,aes(x=month))+geom_histogram()
# specify y aesthetics
ggplot(data=nycflights,aes(x=month, y=dep_delay))+geom_histogram(stat='identity')
```

## how to choose an on-time airport
```{r ontime-percentage}

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
