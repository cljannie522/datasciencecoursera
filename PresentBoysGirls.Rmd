## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r present prop_boy_girl}
present <- present %>% mutate(prop_boy_girl=boys/girls)
ggplot(data=present, aes(x=year, y=prop_boy_girl)) +geom_line()
```

```{r present total}
present <- present %>% mutate(total=boys+girls)
ggplot(data=present, aes(x=year, y=total))+geom_line()
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
